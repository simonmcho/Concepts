## HOW THE INTERNET WORKS

### PART ONE - FRONT END DEVELOPMENT
- Front end consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Browser makes request to server (another computer)
- Computers, when connected to the Internet, gets an IP Address
- Computers with "server software" can be accessed, hence they are servers. 
- When client/browser requests for a domain name, the ISP takes the domain name and does a Domain Name Service lookup to see which IP Address is configured for that requested domain name
- Once connected to the server, the server sends a response to the request
- The browser can interpret what the server responded with, and knows what it's showing the user due to the content type of the response. 
- So, the response from the server has a file and content type.
- The browser knows how to parse the file due to the content type
- Goes down the HTML, pauses when there's a request for an asset (eg. `<link href="/styles/main.css/">`)
